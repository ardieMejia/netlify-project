# netlify-project
Just a personal website, meant to organize my thoughts. A repository (not the Git kind) of sorts of all the things I have learnt, and will learn (or wished to learn). Also has RSS feeds of cool and classy woodworking resources/channels or Linux distro news and some other news related to software. Will include a script in the future that auto generates articles from a .txt file without the need for PHP to create a huge CMS of sorts.  The script will also include:
 - Auto-generator of index page of the articles for the website.
 - Auto-generates date and timestamp for each article. 
 - Ability to update and delete an article.
