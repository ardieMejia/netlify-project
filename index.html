                <p>
                    This is my failed tenon saw. It was my first ever attempt at making a tenon saw with a brass back. The real devil that defeated this project was the brass back. Steel bending is not a joke, it is a skill my itself. At the time of making this, I dremeled a rough groove with no jig to guide me, and bent it following a Youtube guide online, where the guy hammered a steel held in a vise to bend it. Ther result was quite ugly, and not straight. Bending it was also not easy, despite dremeling to almost 1/8 " thickness. If I would redo this, I would spend time making a proper dremel guiding jig, heating the brass to a high temperature, to make it softer.
